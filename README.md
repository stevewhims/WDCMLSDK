# WDCMLSDK
SDK for processing WDCML files

This project is mostly of historical/archeological interest at this point. Before docs.microsoft.com (whose content source is authored in markdown files, and versioned in Source Depot), there was MSDN (whose content souce was authored in a dialect of XML called WDCML, and versioned in git). This project is an SDK that you can use to perform automated/mechanical changes and transformations to WDCML. For example, you might have wanted to insert a paragraph of boilerplate at the top of every topic in a certain project declaring that the API were pre-release.
